    <h3 class="head-tag">J.K Rowling Biography</h3>

    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near
      Bristol, and grew up in Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent,
      in south-east Wales.
      <br />
      <br />
      Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in
      Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a science technician in the Chemistry
      department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself went to school. Anne
      was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in
      1990, before the Harry Potter books were published. Jo also has a younger
      sister, Di.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. ‚ÄúI lived for books,‚Äô‚Äô she has
      said. ‚ÄúI was your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles
      and National Health spectacles.‚Äù
    </p>

    <div class="bio-image">
      <img src="images/J.K-Rowling-Bio-Image.jpg" class="image" alt="" />
    </div>

    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      Jo wanted to be a writer from an early age. She wrote her first book at
      the age of six ‚Äì a story about a rabbit, called ‚ÄòRabbit‚Äô. At just eleven,
      she wrote her first novel ‚Äì about seven cursed diamonds and the people who
      owned them.
      <br /><br />
      Jo studied at Exeter University, where she read so widely outside her
      French and Classics syllabus that she clocked up a fine of ¬£50 for overdue
      books at the University library. Her knowledge of Classics would one day
      come in handy for creating the spells in the Harry Potter series, some of
      which are based on Latin.
      <br /><br />
      Her course included a year in Paris. ‚ÄúI lived in Paris for a year as a
      student,‚Äù Jo tweeted after the 2015 terrorist attacks there. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of
      my favourite places on earth.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      After her degree, she moved to London and worked in a series of jobs,
      including one as a researcher at Amnesty International. ‚ÄúThere in my
      little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of
      totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to
      inform the outside world of what was happening to them.‚Äù She said later.
      ‚ÄúMy small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and
      inspiring experiences of my life.‚Äù
      <br /><br />
      Jo conceived the idea of Harry Potter in 1990 while sitting on a delayed
      train from Manchester to London King‚Äôs Cross. Over the next five years,
      she began to map out all seven books of the series. She wrote mostly in
      longhand and gradually built up a mass of notes, many of which were
      scribbled on odd scraps of paper.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      Taking her notes with her, she moved to northern Portugal to teach English
      as a foreign language, married Jorge Arantes in 1992 and had a daughter,
      Jessica, in 1993. When the marriage ended later that year, she returned to
      the UK to live in Edinburgh, with Jessica and a suitcase containing the
      first three chapters of Harry Potter and the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone.
      <br /><br />
      In Edinburgh, Jo trained as a teacher and began teaching in the city‚Äôs
      schools, but she continued to write in every spare moment.
      <br /><br />
      Having completed the full manuscript, she sent the first three chapters to
      a number of literary agents, one of whom wrote back asking to see the rest
      of it. She says it was ‚Äúthe best letter I had ever received in my life.‚Äù
      The book was first published by Bloomsbury Children‚Äôs Books in June 1997,
      under the name J.K. Rowling. The ‚ÄúK‚Äù stands for Kathleen, her paternal
      grandmother‚Äôs name. It was added at her publisher‚Äôs request, who thought a
      book by an obviously female author might not appeal to the target audience
      of young boys.
      <br /><br />
      J.K. Rowling has also written two small companion volumes, which appear as
      the titles of Harry‚Äôs school books within the novels. Fantastic Beasts and
      Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages were published in March
      2001 in aid of Comic Relief. In December 2008, a third companion volume,
      The Tales of Beedle the Bard was published in aid of her international
      children‚Äôs charity, Lumos. Her latest children‚Äôs novel The Christmas Pig,
      a standalone adventure story about a boy‚Äôs love for his most treasured
      thing and how far he will go to find it, is out now.
      <br /><br />
      J.K. Rowling has been married to Dr Neil Murray since 2001. They live in
      Edinburgh with their son, David (born 2003) and daughter, Mackenzie (born
      2005).

          Harry Potter has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along
          with being famous as the only person ever to survive the Killing
          Curse. The curse was cast by Tom Riddle, better known as Lord
          Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and
          attempted to kill Harry as a baby, due to a prophecy which claimed
          Harry would be able to stop him. As an orphan, Harry was placed in the
          care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Petunia Dursley and Vernon
          Dursley, with their son Dudley Dursley.
