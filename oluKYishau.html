      award-winning journalist, novelist, and short-story writer, was born in
      Lagos, Nigeria. His first novel, In the Name of Our Father, has been a
      subject of theses by students in Nigerian universities. It was described
      by two-time Booker finalist Chigozie Obioma as a 'work of deceptive
      simplicity'. His collection of short stories Vaults of Secrets has
      received rave advance reviews.

      journalism by The Nation reporters has an outstanding name.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      A back page columnist for its Niger-Delta edition, whose finely written
      essays from trivial and somewhat flippant to serious and often sobering
      investigations attract the attention of bigwigsâ€”with reactions that are
      sometimes emotional or an attempt at a cover-upâ€”Yishau parades several
      top-level industry awards.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutUs-details">
      Amazingly, Yishau, who won one of the most coveted industry awards in 2016
      as Columnist of the Year, didnâ€™t start his engaging prose from Tell
      Magazine or The Source, where he once worked and has his name referenced
      often as a thoroughbred professional journalist, the bookish journalist
      started with inspiration he garnered from reading Songs of Solomon, a book
      of the Bible known for its romantic subject matter.
      <br /><br />
      In his early days, after reading the Bible Yishau will go anywhere with
      his pen and paper in his pocket. Instant miracle of ideas flowed
      ceaselessly in his head and many poems and fiction works were born through
      the immersion of his mind into the Songs of Solomon.
